Keep your favorite apps in a smart dock ready for my upcoming product, the "MiniDock", which allows the user to add a 480x2160 screen to their laptop/desktop

### Instructions:
1. Download the repository as a zip file from the top right corner of this GitHub:

2. Download the images of the apps you want to use from here:
      > https://icon-icons.com/pack/Internet-2020/2201
3. Select 256pix and PNG to download the images. Save them in the "dist folder". Name them with the name of the app with no spaces, and all lower case.
4. Open the Applications folder by pressing Win + R and then pasting the following command:
      > shell:AppsFolder
5. Drag and drop the apps you want to use to your dist folder and rename the shortcut to the name of the app without spaces, and all lower case.
6. Your dist folder should now have your two new files: 1 image and 1 shortcut. Both named the same like this:

7. Open the apps.csv file with excel (or notepad) and replace the plus sign with any app you want by just typing its name the same way you wrote it for your images and shortcuts. Here is how ours looks like!
